# Grow-grub ü•¶

## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Grow-grub is the final project I worked on with 6 other talented developers at Dev Academy. It is an application that helps you become a better gardener. It provides comprehensive gardening knowledge for vegetables of your choice, including detailed planting instructions. You can design your garden within the app based on your real-life garden layout. The daily task page helps you stay on top of watering, weeding, and harvesting your vegetables.

Seven of us worked closely together on this project, building a full-stack web app in just seven days. It was an incredible experience, and we are extremely proud of what we achieved.

## Why did we build this app

When getting into gardening, people with different levels of knowledge face various problems and sometimes don't know how to tackle them. Each of our group members experienced this when it comes to gardening. So, we built an app to provide tailored knowledge for different planting inquiries, making gardening easier for everyone. We also wanted it to be fun and user-friendly for new gardeners to ensure a great gardening and user experience.
